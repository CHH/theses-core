# Move along. Nothing to see here yet.

_What's this?_

This, dear reader, is a fairly lacking, hacky, pre-alpha, primitive blogging engine built
on top of Silex, PHPCR (with Jackalope Doctrine DBAL). It's going to
replace my Jekyll based site at <http://christophh.net>
hopefully sometime in Q3 2014.

You can have a look at the code. It's MIT licensed, but I'm not looking
for contributions just yet. View it as a proof of concept. When (and if)
it launches into production I'll properly opensource it with docs and
everything. Stay tuned by following me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/hochchristoph).

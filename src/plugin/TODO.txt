TODO:

- Provide a framework for easier definition of settings panes for
  plugins, with automatic form generation from a definition and saving to the plugin
  settings namespace
  - Each plugin has /settings/plugin/{plugin}/
  - Autogenerated form (with Symfony Form Component?)
  - Return form in plugin method (getSettingsPanel()?)
  - Post route which saves each valid form field to the plugin's
    settings in PHPCR
- Easier building of admin panes
